# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System
## Overview
The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on user inputs such as symptoms, medical history, and other relevant health data. The system leverages several predictive models to provide accurate and timely predictions, helping users make informed decisions regarding their health.
This is combination of 3 different disease prediction system(heart disease, diabetes, parkinson's disease 
## Features
* Multiple Disease Support: The system can predict multiple diseases including, but not limited to, diabetes, heart disease, and more.
* User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive interface allows users to input their data easily.
* Real-time Predictions: Receive immediate predictions based on the input data.
* Machine Learning Models: Utilizes various machine learning algorithms for improved accuracy and reliability.
## Usage
Input Data: Enter the required information such as symptoms, age, gender, medical history, etc.
Run Prediction: Click the 'Predict' button to run the analysis.
View Results: The predicted diseases and their likelihoods will be displayed, along with recommendations for further action.
